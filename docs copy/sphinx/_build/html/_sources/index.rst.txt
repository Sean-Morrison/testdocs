IDLspec2D: The SDSS BOSS Data Reduction Pipeline
================================================
This page describes the BOSS Data Reduction Pipeline `idlspec2d <https://github.com/sdss/idlspec2d>`_.

The BOSS DRP (officially known as IDLspec2D) is really a series of steps run in sequence. There are some initial steps to produce the plans and supplementary information required. After which, uubatchpbs is used to produce the redux scripts. These scripts are really a wrapper script designed to run each of the individual steps on a field-mjd basis by the slurm manager at CHPC (Utah) or manually on any computer. Starting with the v6_2_x version of the pipeline, the internal python commands have been organized into a boss_drp package within the IDLspec2D GitHub repo.

The Pipeline can be run in various ways, where the catchup method is designed to run a large number of MJDs in a short time and the daily run method is designed to run for 1 (or a few) MJDs.

Setup Requirements
-------------------

A number of system environmental variables and paths are required to run the BOSS DRP.

Running at the University of Utah CHPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At Utah, modules (github.com/sdss/sdss_modules) are used to maintain the the required packages and paths. For the BOSS pipeline, the bhm modules are used to manage these for the BOSS pipeline.

Environmental Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

export DATABASE_PROFILE="pipelines"
export RUN2D="v6_1_2"
export RUN1D="v6_1_2"
export BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX="/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss50/sdsswork/bhm/boss/spectro/redux"
export SDHDRFIX_DIR="/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss50/software/git/sdss/sdsscore_test/main"

export SDSSCORE_DIR="/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss50/software/git/sdss/sdsscore_test/main"

Paths
^^^^^

export IDL_PATH="$IDL_PATH:$IDLSPEC2D_DIR"
export PATH="$PATH:$IDLSPEC2D_DIR/bin"
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$IDLSPEC2D_DIR/python"
